# Advent of code 2022 for Rust practice

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) provides a good chance for me to learn the Rust language. [This blogger](https://www.peterbaumgartner.com/blog/learning-rust-with-advent-of-code-2022/) used it to learn the basic syntax and get to know the core and useful libraries in Rust, and I follow their suit. The year I used was [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

An example Rust Github [repo](https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2022/tree/master) of the same advent, from timvisee, is helpful for reference purposes. It also provides some basic boilerplates regarding how to arrange the Rust projects and from which I can learn the language.
