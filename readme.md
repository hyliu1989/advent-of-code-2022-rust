# Advent of code 2022 for Rust practice

Advent of code provides a good chance for me to learn the Rust language. I would like to learn the basic syntax and get to know the core and useful libraries of Rust from this practice.

An example Rust Github [repo](https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2022/tree/master) of the same advent, from timvisee, is helpful for reference purposes. It also provides some basic boilerplates regarding how to arrange the Rust projects and from which I can learn the language.
